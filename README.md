##  Overview

As Bangladesh moves deeper into the digital era, its legal infrastructure must keep pace with rapidly evolving threats and technologies. Although the Digital Security Act 2018 was a major step forward, it now requires refinement to ensure it supports both security and digital freedoms. This project proposes modern reforms inspired by global examples to future-proof Bangladesh’s cyber law ecosystem.

## Existing Cyber Laws In Bangladesh

Bangladesh’s existing cyber laws include the ICT Act (2006), the Digital Security Act (2018), and the Cyber Security Act (2023), with the most recent update being the Cyber Security Ordinance (2025). These laws aim to address issues like cybercrime, online harassment, and digital misinformation.
###  ICT Act, 2006
- First comprehensive cyber law in Bangladesh.
- Addressed hacking, online fraud, and spreading false information.
- Section 57 became controversial for being used to suppress freedom of speech.
- Eventually replaced due to widespread criticism.

###  Digital Security Act, 2018
- Introduced to combat fake news, cyber terrorism, and online harassment.
- Faced backlash for restricting freedom of expression.
- Repealed in 2023 for its misuse and lack of clarity.

###  Cyber Security Act, 2023
- Replaced the Digital Security Act.
- Aimed to reduce punishments and be more balanced.
- Criticized for vague language and lack of strong data protection.

###  Cyber Security Ordinance, 2025
- Latest legal update addressing modern cyber threats.
- Recognizes internet access as a basic right.
- Targets online abuse, cyberbullying, and AI-based crimes.
- Bans online gambling and reduces jail time for speech-related offenses.
- Enables faster removal of harmful content with court approval.

These laws aim to protect citizens online while balancing digital rights and national security.

### Key Issues:
- Unclear and overly broad definitions
